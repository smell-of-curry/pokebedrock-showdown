# A PokeBedrock Fork of Pok√©mon Showdown

## Goal

Try to keep this fork with the least amount of changes to the original codebase. However since we NEED to make changes to make it work in minecraft we need to keep all changes small and prefix them all with `// @pokebedrock` ensuring when merge conflicts come (when syncing with the original codebase) we can easily see what changes are needed to be made.

## Current Changes:

### Core System Changes:
- **Reworked Config**: Modified to not use reading/writing to files as script api doesn't support that.
- **Better Type Safety**: Added more specific type definitions throughout the codebase.
- **ESM Compatibility**: Fixed compatibility issues with Minecraft Bedrock's Script API.
- **Removed Dynamic Requires**: `sim/dex` & `sim/teams` now uses a static import map to avoid dynamic requires (which is not supported in Minecraft Bedrock's Script API).

### Pokemon Data & Features:
- **UUID System**: Added a whole UUID system which allows pokemon to be searched easily by interpreter.
- **Cosmetic Forms**: Added extensive cosmetic forme support for many Pokemon including:
  - Pikachu variants (Witch, Captain, Santa, Detective, Doll)
  - Halloween forms (Sandshrew, Sandslash, Gastly, Haunter, Gengar, Celebi, Darkrai, Trubbish, Garbodor, Golett, Golurk, Gible, Gabite, Garchomp, Zoroark)
  - Christmas forms (Mew, Gardevoir, Gallade, Comfey, Snorlax)
  - Seasonal forms (Torterra-StPatrick, Spheal-Watermelon)
  - Independence forms (Cubone, Dugtrio, Houndoom, Wailord)
  - Spinda pattern variants
  - Vivillon Valentine pattern

### Evolution System Enhancements:
- **Enhanced Evolution Properties**: Added better properties to describe evolutions in pokedex:
  - `evoTime`: Specifies time of day for evolution (day/night/evening)
  - `evoGender`: Required gender for evolution
  - `evoPartySpecies`: Required species in party for evolution
  - `evoTradeSpecies`: Required trade partner species
  - `evoPartyType`: Required type in party for evolution
  - `evoKnownMoveType`: Required move type for evolution
  - `evoMinAffection`: Minimum affection required for evolution
  - `evoRelativePhysicalStats`: Stat comparison requirements for evolution
  - `evoStatusEffect`: Required status condition for evolution
  - `evoBiomes`: Required biomes for evolution
  - `evoPriority`: Evolution priority system
  - `evoCosmeticForme`: Required cosmetic forme for evolution
  - `evoType`: Enhanced evolution type system
  - `changeEvent`: Event that triggers forme changes

### Battle System:
- **Bag Item System**: Added comprehensive bag items with actions for:
  - Healing items (Potion, Super Potion, Hyper Potion, Max Potion, Full Restore)
  - Revival items (Revive, Max Revive)
  - Status cure items (Pecha Berry, Cheri Berry, etc.)
  - PP restoration (Leppa Berry with move-specific targeting)
  - Stat-boosting berries (Sitrus Berry, Oran Berry, etc.)
- **Revive System**: Added `revive()` function for Pokemon to handle revival mechanics.
- **Enhanced Heal Messages**: Added `DETAILS` to `-heal` instruction so we can read the pokemon being healed.
- **Critical Hit Enhancement**: Added source parameter to `-crit` messages for better tracking.

### Protocol & Communication:
- **New Instructions**: Added simulator protocol instructions:
  - `bag-item`: For using bag items on Pokemon
  - `used-ball`: For tracking ball usage
  - `forceforme`: For forcing Pokemon forme changes/evolutions
- **Enhanced Details**: Send `detailschange` after mega evolution so it will look good.
- **Kill Tracking**: Added `-killed` instruction to send messages when a pokemon is killed.

### Move & Battle Mechanics:
- **PP System**: Enhanced PP tracking with current/max PP support from movesInfo.
- **Move Targeting**: Better type safety for move targets.
- **Status Effects**: Enhanced status effect handling for bag items and berries.

### Technical Improvements:
- **Type Definitions**: Improved TypeScript definitions throughout the codebase.
- **Const Assertions**: Added `as const` to data tables for better type inference.
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling for bag items and forme changes.
